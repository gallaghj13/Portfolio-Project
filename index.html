            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I moved out to Boulder, Colorado from Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 2015 because I wanted to live
                in the mountains. I took a job in a restaraunt to make ends meet while I spent as much time as I
                could climbing. So, for the past six years I've been bartending and managing at the Dark Horse in 
                Boulder. 
            </p>

                Over the past year, with the pandemic, and the subsequent shutdowns and restrictions on the service
                industry, I realized that it was time for me to move on. I thought of learning how to code because
                of friends in the industry. They encouraged me to pursue coding, so, here I am in the DU coding bootcamp.
                My favorite part of learning web development has been the problem solving aspect. There is nothing
                more satisfying than figuring out a problem.
