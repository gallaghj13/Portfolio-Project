# Portfolio-Project

## Description

I created this website to be a portfolio for my future work as a software developer. I wanted to create something that could tell a future employer a little about myself, show them what I am capable of coding, provide a resume and contact information if they are interested in reaching out to me.

## Usage

The webiste is fairly straightforward. The header includes a navigation bar that links to each section of the webpage, and a resume button that opens to a pdf of my resume. The pictures in the Work section are linked to projects. The Contact Me section includes links to my github and linkedIn accounts.
